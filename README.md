#Sample app to fetch issue from github.

I could have improved the app if given more time by
* Adding a global error page for unmapped request.
* Using d3js for displaying numbers.
* If github has api in which we can pass the created_at date of issue , I could have hit concurrent request insted of iterating over all issue result
